# Things we learned
- I learned how to manage and convert data in python and javascript, the translation between those langauages when dealing with things like arrays vs lists vs dictionaries can make things difficult sometimes
- CORS issues caused our workflow to be hindered, with an unclear error messages we didn't end up solving that problem. It just slowed us down a lot. 
- Database management and interaction with forms was really fun to work with. Despite it being difficult with multi-part forms. 
- I hate fly.io so much
